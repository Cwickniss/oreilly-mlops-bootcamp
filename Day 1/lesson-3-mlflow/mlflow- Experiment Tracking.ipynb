    "Our goal in this notebook is to demonstrate the power of **experiment tracking**  using **MLflow**—an open-source platform designed to simplify the management of machine learning workflows. In the world of machine learning, tracking experiments is crucial for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and effective model management. MLflow allows us to log not only parameters, metrics, and models but also track and compare multiple experiments over time. This makes it easier to optimize model performance, fine-tune hyperparameters, and maintain a history of all experiments for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use MLflow to track and manage the development of a classification model aimed at predicting **air quality**. Our dataset contains various environmental features, including temperature, humidity, pollutant levels (such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO), and factors like proximity to industrial areas and population density. By building a predictive model, we aim to classify air quality into categories like \"Good\" , \"Moderate\" or \"Hazardous\" based on these features. Throughout the process, we will log every aspect of the model training and evaluation, from hyperparameters to performance metrics, ensuring we have a clear and organized record of our work with MLflow."
